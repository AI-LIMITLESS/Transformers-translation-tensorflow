# Transformer (Tensorflow)
---

This repository contains an implementation of the transformer model for translation using Tensorflow, based on the original paper ["Attention is All You Need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. The transformer model is a neural network architecture that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation.
